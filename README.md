PID Line Follower Robot 

This is a simple yet efficient line-following robot built using embedded C on Arduino (or any other microcontroller used). It uses a PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control algorithm to follow a black line on a white surface with smooth and stable motion.

Project Features

PID Control Algorithm for smooth line tracking

IR Sensors to detect the line path

DC Motors with motor driver (e.g., L298N) for movement

Adjustable PID Constants (Kp, Ki, Kd) for tuning performance

Handles sharp turns and curves effectively

How It Works

The robot uses multiple IR sensors to read the position of the line and calculate the error from the center. The PID controller processes this error to determine the motor speeds, making the robot adjust its direction to stay on the path.

PID Tuning Tips
Start with Ki = 0, Kd = 0, and increase Kp until it starts oscillating.

Gradually introduce Kd to reduce the oscillation.

Add a small Ki if there's a steady-state error.
